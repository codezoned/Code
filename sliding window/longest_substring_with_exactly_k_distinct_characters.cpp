/*
Given a string you need to print the size of the longest possible substring that has exactly K unique characters. If there is no possible substring then print -1.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "aabacbebebe", K = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: "cbebebe" is the longest 
substring with K distinct characters.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
S = "aaaa", K = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There's no substring with K
distinct characters.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function longestKSubstr() which takes the string S and an integer K as input and returns the length of the longest substring with exactly K distinct characters. If there is no substring with exactly K distinct characters then return -1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
1<=K<=105
