Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note:

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:

This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?









class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n=citations.size();
        if(!n) return 0;
        int si=0, ei=n-1, mid;
        while(si<=ei){
            mid=si+(ei-si)/2;
            if(citations[mid]==n-mid) return citations[mid];
            else if(citations[mid]>n-mid) ei=mid-1;
            else si=mid+1;
        }
        return n-si;
    }
};










// Brute force
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n=citations.size();
        int h=1, res=0;
        while(h<=n){
            int cnt=0;
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                if(citations[i]>=h) cnt++;
            }
            if(cnt>=h)
                res=h;

            h++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
